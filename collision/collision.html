        <em>Abstract</em> — Collision detection is a fundamental problem in computer graphics and robotics, with applications ranging from video games to autonomous navigation. In this paper, we present a comprehensive mathematical formulation and implementation of two efficient collision detection algorithms: Axis-Aligned Bounding Boxes (AABB) and the Separating Axis Theorem (SAT). Our approach leverages the convexity of the objects under consideration to reduce the computational complexity of collision checks. We derive the algorithms from first principles, grounding our approach in linear algebra and computational geometry. The AABB algorithm constructs tight-fitting bounding boxes around objects, allowing for quick overlap tests. The SAT algorithm, in turn, determines if two convex objects intersect by projecting their vertices onto a set of separating axes. We provide detailed pseudocode for both algorithms, as well as a discussion of their computational complexity and performance characteristics. Through extensive simulations and benchmarks, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in detecting collisions between complex, real-world objects. Our framework aims to provide a solid theoretical and practical foundation for the development of efficient collision detection systems, with applications in robotics, computer graphics, and beyond. By formalizing and optimizing these fundamental algorithms, we hope to enable the creation of more responsive, accurate, and scalable collision detection pipelines, paving the way for novel applications in fields such as autonomous navigation, virtual reality, and physics-based simulation.

    <h1>Introduction</h1>
    <section>
      <p>
        Collision detection is a critical component of many computer graphics and robotics applications, enabling the realistic simulation of physical interactions between objects. Two widely used algorithms for efficient collision detection are Axis-Aligned Bounding Boxes (AABB) and the Separating Axis Theorem (SAT). In this paper, we present a formal mathematical treatment of these algorithms, along with optimized implementations that leverage the convexity of the objects under consideration. Our approach is grounded in linear algebra and computational geometry, providing a rigorous foundation for the development of high-performance collision detection systems.
      </p>
    </section>

    <h1>Axis-Aligned Bounding Boxes (AABB)</h1>
    <section>
      <p>
        The AABB algorithm constructs tight-fitting bounding boxes around objects, with the boxes' faces aligned with the coordinate axes. This alignment allows for efficient overlap tests, as the projections of the bounding boxes onto the coordinate axes can be easily compared. The algorithm proceeds as follows:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>For each object, find the minimum and maximum coordinates of its vertices along each axis (\(x\), \(y\), and \(z\)).</li>
        <li>Construct an AABB using these minimum and maximum coordinates as the box's extents.</li>
        <li>To test for collision between two AABBs, check if their projections onto each axis overlap. If the projections overlap on all axes, the AABBs intersect, indicating a potential collision between the objects.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        The computational complexity of the AABB algorithm is \(O(n)\), where \(n\) is the number of vertices in the object. The algorithm's efficiency stems from its ability to quickly rule out non-intersecting objects based on their AABBs, reducing the need for more expensive, precise collision checks.
      </p>
    </section>

    <h1>Separating Axis Theorem (SAT)</h1>
    <section>
      <p>
        The SAT algorithm leverages the fact that two convex objects do not intersect if there exists a line (or plane, in 3D) onto which their projections do not overlap. This line or plane is called a separating axis. The algorithm works as follows:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>Generate a set of potential separating axes by taking the cross product of the edges of one object with the edges of the other object.</li>
        <li>For each potential separating axis:
          <ol>
            <li>Project the vertices of both objects onto the axis.</li>
            <li>Check if the projections overlap. If they do not, the axis is a separating axis, and the objects do not intersect.</li>
          </ol>
        </li>
        <li>If no separating axis is found, the objects are intersecting.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        The SAT algorithm has a computational complexity of \(O(n^2)\) in the worst case, where \(n\) is the number of vertices in the objects. However, in practice, the algorithm's performance is often much better, as it can quickly identify separating axes and terminate early.
      </p>
    </section>

    <h1>Implementation</h1>
    <section>
      <p>
        We provide optimized implementations of the AABB and SAT algorithms in JavaScript, suitable for integration into real-world collision detection systems. The code leverages typed arrays and vectorized operations to maximize performance, while maintaining readability and modularity.
      </p>
      <p>
        The AABB implementation calculates the bounding box for an object by iterating over its vertices and tracking the minimum and maximum coordinates along each axis. The resulting AABB is stored as a set of six coordinates, representing the box's minimum and maximum extents.
      </p>
      <p>
        The SAT implementation first transforms the vertices of the objects into world space using their respective model matrices. It then generates unique separating axes by taking the cross product of the edges of the objects. For each axis, the vertices are projected onto the axis, and the overlap between the projections is checked. If a separating axis is found, the objects are not intersecting, and the algorithm terminates. If no separating axis is found, the algorithm returns the minimum overlap and the corresponding axis, which can be used to calculate the collision response.
      </p>
    </section>

    <h1>Results and Discussion</h1>
    <section>
      <p>
        We evaluate the performance of our AABB and SAT implementations on a range of benchmark scenarios, involving objects of varying complexity and spatial configuration. The results demonstrate the efficiency and robustness of the algorithms, with collision detection times scaling well with the number and complexity of the objects.
      </p>
      <p>
        The AABB algorithm proves particularly effective in quickly ruling out non-intersecting objects, while the SAT algorithm provides more precise collision information at a higher computational cost. By combining these two approaches in a hierarchical collision detection pipeline, we can achieve real-time performance on complex scenes.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our implementation also highlights the importance of leveraging the convexity of the objects under consideration. By working with convex hulls or bounding volumes, we can significantly reduce the computational burden of collision detection, enabling more efficient and scalable simulations.
      </p>

    <h1>Conclusion</h1>
    <section>
      <p>
        In this paper, we presented a formal mathematical treatment and optimized implementation of the AABB and SAT algorithms for efficient collision detection. By grounding our approach in linear algebra and computational geometry, we provide a rigorous foundation for the development of high-performance collision detection systems.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of these algorithms in detecting collisions between complex, real-world objects, while highlighting the importance of leveraging object convexity for computational efficiency. The modular and optimized nature of our implementation makes it suitable for integration into a wide range of applications, from computer graphics to robotics.
      </p>
      <p>
        Future work will focus on extending our approach to handle non-convex objects, as well as integrating our collision detection pipeline with physics-based simulation and constraint resolution techniques. By continuing to refine and formalize these fundamental algorithms, we aim to enable the creation of more responsive, accurate, and scalable collision detection systems, paving the way for novel applications in fields such as autonomous navigation, virtual reality, and beyond.
